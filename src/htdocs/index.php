<p>The US Geological Survey maintains a variety of fault and volcano monitoring
  sites around the western United States. Instruments at these sites include
  strainmeters, tiltmeters and creepmeters, as well as other environmental
  parameters such as temperature and barometric pressure.</p>

<p>The data are collected and monitored to help understand how, when, and why
  large earthquakes, fault slip and volcanic activity occur. The measurements
  provide a near real-time record of the related crustal deformation before,
  during and after events. The goal is to better understand these natural
  processes, and use these data to reduce the earthquake and volcanic hazards
  associated with them.</p>

<p>This web site provides <a href="plots.php">data plots</a> and
  <a href="download.php">data downloads</a> for many instruments that are
  concentrated in areas where large earthquakes are likely to occur in
  California and areas of known volcanic activity (Long Valley, CA). In
  particular, the USGS has concentrated instrumentation efforts in the San
  Francisco Bay Area, near San Juan Bautista and Parkfield, and the Long Valley,
  CA and Southern California regions.</p>

<p class="disclaimer">The plots and data on this site are generated
  automatically and are not reviewed. They should not be used for engineering,
  legal, or any other critical applications.</p>
